### Inputs Explained

See also the [`examples`](https://github.com/theiagen/theiavalidate/tree/main/examples) folder for example inputs.

#### Required: `table1` and `table2`

These are the two TSV files that will be examined. The order of the tables does not matter.

**CAUTION:** each table requires exactly the same number of samples and matching sample names (or values in the first column). If the tables do not have the same samples, the script will fail. There can be no additional samples in either table as well.

#### Required: `columns_to_compare`

The `columns_to_compare` variable determines what columns will be examined. This is a comma separated list, such as: `"assembly_length,est_coverage,gambit_predicted_taxon"`. The order of the columns does not matter. All other columns not listed will be ignored.

#### Optional: `validation_criteria`

An example validation_criteria.tsv file is shown below. The first column is the column name in the two tables. The second column is the validation criteria to use for that column. This file **expects a header** and is tab-delimited.

**CAUTION:** Any column names in this file must also be in `columns_to_compare` for additional validation criteria to be performed.

```text
column_name     validation_criteria
column1         EXACT
column2         SET
column3         0.01
```

Currently implemented validation criteria include:

| validation_criteria | explanation |
| --- | --- |
| EXACT | The values in the two columns must be exactly the same; in this case `[foo,bar] != [bar,foo]`. When applied to columns referencing files, file contents will be compared to check if they are identical.|
| SET | The values in the two columns must be the same set of values; in this case `[foo,bar] == [bar,foo]`. When applied to columns referencing files, the lines within the files will be sorted alphabetically before comparing.|
| \<FLOAT\> | The values in the two columns must be within `<FLOAT>*100` of each other; e.g., 0.3 -> 30% difference allowed. |
| IGNORE | The values in the two columns are assumed to match; in this case `foo == bar`. |


#### Optional: `column_translation`

An example column_translation.tsv file is shown below. The first column is the column name in one table, and the second column is the corresponding column name in the other table. _All columns with the name in the first column will be renamed to match the corresponding column name in the second column_. This file has **no header** and is tab-delimited.

```
column_name1_table1    column_name1_table2
column_name2_table1    column_name2_table2
original_column_name   new_column_name
```

For example, if `table1` has a column named `column_name1_table1`, it will be renamed to `column_name1_table2` in all outputs and comparisons.

#### Optional: `output_prefix`

The output prefix variable is a string that will prefix all output file. Do not include any whitespace. The default is `theiavalidate`.

#### Optional: `na_values`

The `na_values` variable is a list of values that should be considered NA by Pandas. The default list is _different_ than the default na_values list used by Pandas. This is because some outputs are legitimately `"NA"` and should not be considered missing data by Pandas. All and _only_ the values in this list will be replaced with `pandas.na` or `numpy.nan` in the output files and comparisons.

#### Optional: `verbose` and `debug`

These two outputs increase the verbosity of the logging system to `INFO` and `DEBUG`, respectively. `DEBUG` produces far more output than `INFO` and may be excessive for non-debugging purposes. If both `--debug` and `--verbose` are present, `--debug` takes precendence. If no verbosity is specified, the logging level is set to `ERROR`.

### Outputs Explained

See also the [`examples`](https://github.com/theiagen/theiavalidate/tree/main/examples) folder for example outputs.

Or, you can copy and paste following command in the Docker image to generate the example outputs.

```bash
theiavalidate.py \
  theiavalidate/examples/example-table1.tsv \
  theiavalidate/examples/example-table2.tsv \
  -c "assembly_length,gambit_predicted_taxon,amrfinderplus_amr_core_genes,extra_column" \
  -l theiavalidate/examples/example-column_translation.tsv \
  -m theiavalidate/examples/example-validation_criteria.tsv \
  -o example-output
```

#### `filtered_<table1_name>` and `filtered_<table2_name>`

These files are the original input files with _only_ the columns specified in `columns_to_compare` and all columns being renamed to what is specified in the `column_translation.tsv` file. These files are provided to allow the user to see what columns are being compared and to allow the user to manually inspect the original data.

#### `<output_prefix>_exact_differences.tsv`

This file is a tab-delimited file containing all rows and columns specified in `columns_to_compare`. The only values in this file are the values that are not exactly the same between the two tables. 

#### `<output_prefix>_validation_criteria_differences.tsv`

**NOTE:** This file is only provided if a `validation_criteria.tsv` file is provided. This file is a tab-delimited file containing all rows and columns specified in `columns_to_compare`. The only values in this file are the values that do not meet the validation criteria specified in the `validation_criteria.tsv` file.

#### `<output_prefix>_summary.html` and `<output_prefix>_summary.pdf`

This file (available as an HTML and PDF) is a summary of the differences between the two tables. It contains the following information:

- the date `theiavalidate.py` was run
- as rows, the columns specified in `columns_to_compare`
- as columns:
  - the number of rows in `table1` that have values
  - the number of rows in `table2` that have values
  - the number of differences (exact match)
  - the corresponding validation criteria (if provided)
  - the number of samples failing the validation criteria

If a `validation_criteria.tsv` file was provided, a definition of the (currently implemented) validation criteria are provided at the bottom of the table

#### `<sample>_<column>_diff.txt`
Shows the differing lines within mismatching files for a given sample and column. Each pair of mismatching files generates a separate file.
